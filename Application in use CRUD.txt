I use XAMPP to create database MySQL.



Use extension POSTMAN in chrome to CRUD
 - Create: POST in http://localhost:8080/api/contact/
 - Read: GET in http://localhost:8080/api/contact/ or http://localhost:8080/api/contact/{id}
 - Update: PUT in http://localhost:8080/api/contact/{id}
 - Delete: DELETE in http://localhost:8080/api/contact/{id}
